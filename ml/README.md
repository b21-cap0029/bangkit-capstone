# Dataset

Example result in `result_example.csv`. Need `requests` package to run. Script will fetch at most `fetch_max` new tweets every time you run it. You can terminate anytime and pick up where you left off by re-running the script (but the counter resets to 0). To start fresh, remove `next_token.txt`.

Example in text cleaning and processing is in `Traffic Incident Classification`. The reference dataset (`twitter_label_manual.csv`) and exploratory analysis part come from [Traffic Accident in Indonesia](https://www.kaggle.com/dodyagung/accident).
